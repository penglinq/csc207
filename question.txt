1. Is it possible to write a class without the initialization method that has the same name as the class if we want to use new to allocate an object of that class? i.e. Is it possible to create a class of which we use instances without a constructor? 
2. Why the following code is wrong (warning:
	- Syntax error, insert "enum Identifier" to complete EnumHeaderName
	- Syntax error, insert "EnumBody" to complete BlockStatement):
	@SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
	return (T) data[i];

while the following is right:
	@SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
	T ret = (T) data[i];
	return ret;
3. For time complexity, can we have multiple inputs? For example, T(n, m) = n*m to count the sum of elements in an 2D array with size n * m.
4. What does s.char mean (s is a String)? (in midterm1 pratice)
5. 3.7 reading last page: I don't understand the in & out parameter and how they are related to the super and extend.
6. What's the differences between "throw" and "throws"?
7. 3.16 lab : For "map" (first part) in the file HigherOrderFunctionsQ.java, I want to make one function class for all the three cases, just differed by the input type. Is that possible? If so, how can I make a generic type that only contains Integer, Double, String, i.e. the three concrete types I will use? (Otherwise I will have to implement for other types since I implement the interface Function) 
Also, how to "come up with a function that factors out the redundant structure from these three functions" for "Fold"?
8. How to handle the resource leak, e.g. to close a Scanner? Add "@SuppressWarnings("resource")"?
9.How to get input from System repeatitively if I want the program to wait for the next input? (scanner may block waiting for next input and just return null)
9. 4.18 lab: how to do part2? I solved this with TreeSet<Pair> but it seems that I didn't get the intention of this question.
10. Just to make sure, is queue FILO? or FIFO? And stack is FILO, right?
11. How to use try-catch to handle "Exceptions"?
12. HW9: Is the HuffmanTree wrong? Because when there are only 5 and 4 left in the priority queue, 4 should be in front of 5. Then all the huffman codes should change accordingly.
13. HW9: Why should all files even saved as string of 0 and 1 have integer multiples of 8 bytes? For example, I can't write a file consisting of only "1" but "10000000"?
14. HW9: I'm working on a Mac. Why TextEdit and MacVim interpret /n (ASCII = 10) differently (newline in TextEdit, but no newline if it's at the end of the file in MacVim)?
15. Practice Final solution: Problem 1 (5): why for small arrays, insertion sort is preferrable over quicksort? Or should that be for "almost-sorted arrays"?
16. Practice Final solution: Problem 4 last cell: why for "A a = new C();", f3() does not type check? I'm not sure if I understand "type checks" mean.
17. Practice Final solution: Problem 7 B & s.length < ss.size() and C & s.length < ss.size() why should both of them never hold? It seems to me that it can sometimes hold.



Contents to review before taking a test:
1. Draw stack and heap
2. standart list operation (especially .iterator());
